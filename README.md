## Current Branch Activity
1. The sole focus of this branch is to set up Gulp so that it reloads changes to the .SCSS files.
2. At the end of this we will make a few small changes and additions to demonstrate reloading.

## Current Gulp Tasks
- `gulp serve` uses browserSync & opens a project in the browser. Reloads when you save.
- `gulp sass` compiles scss files as css.
- `gulp dev` runs both the serve and sass commands. Watches for changes in any of those files.
