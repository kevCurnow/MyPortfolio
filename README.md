## Current Branch Activity
1. The sole focus of this branch is to set start working on a customized navbar.
2. The _navbar.scss file includes some changes to the navbar hamburger button. When it responds, it changes to an X.
3. A few sass variables were also added for company color palette.
4. An id is added to each major section. These will correspond to the href on the navbar allow for navigation throughout.

## Current Gulp Tasks
- `gulp serve` uses browserSync & opens a project in the browser. Reloads when you save.
- `gulp sass` compiles scss files as css.
- `gulp dev` runs both the serve and sass commands. Watches for changes in any of those files.
